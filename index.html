                <p class="section-content">
                    To overcome the prominent limitations of Egyptian pharmacy apps, we propose building a
                    user-friendly application “MedLife” for selling/purchasing drugs, vitamins, medications,
                    and other products, but more importantly for making the experience of users better. It
                    will also facilitate the process of registering pharmacies in any location and becoming
                    part of the system. Furthermore, MedLife will take the competition to a whole new level by
                    applying machine learning and deep learning for time series forecasting of drug sales.
                    That way, our app not only allows pharmacists to track the sales of products, but also
                    access drug sales predictions geographically. For example, a pharmacy in Cairo can know
                    which drugs are going to be the most sold drugs in the next month. Also, we offer a
                    solution for users who 3 might find it difficult to read prescriptions by building an OCR
                    reader that will read the prescription and tell them the drugs’ names directly.

                        <h3 class="card-title">Backend</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our system has been constructed using a microservices architecture to ensure exceptional scalability and improved fault tolerance. To align with the underlying business logic, we have categorized each requirement into its corresponding microservice. Additionally, we have leveraged the use of an S3 Bucket for image storage, allowing us to optimize request sizes and guarantee quicker response time. Moreover, effective communication has been established through the utilization of a message broker, enhancing overall system efficiency.

                        <p>
                            In the machine learning component, we have developed a Prescription Reader comprising a two-layer pipeline. The initial layer utilizes Google Vision for optical character recognition (OCR), albeit with suboptimal accuracy results. The subsequent layer employs a transformer model (T5) that has been trained on a dataset encompassing 2000 drug names. This enhanced model achieves a notable accuracy rate of 90% and significantly enhances the overall accuracy of the pipeline by 55%, resulting in a final accuracy rate of <b>70%</b>.

                        <p>
                            The mobile application is built using the <b>MVVM</b> (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, combined with the <b>BLoC</b> (Business Logic Component) state management pattern. Flutter, a cross-platform development framework, was chosen to ensure the app's functionality on multiple platforms. The primary focus of the mobile app is to facilitate interactions between patients and pharmacists.

                        <p>
                            The web application is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library renowned for building user interfaces. Its primary role is to efficiently manage administrative tasks, including the handling of admin and subadmin roles, product management within our system, and generating reports
                            The application adopts Redux as its state management solution, which offers a centralized store for managing and updating application state. This approach ensures a predictable and efficient flow of data and simplifying complex data interactions.

                        <p>
                            To ensure the reliable hosting of our application, we have leveraged Amazon EC2 instances. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides scalable and flexible virtual servers, allowing us to deploy our application with ease. By utilizing EC2 instances, we can confidently deliver a robust and high-performance application to our users.<br>

                            To optimize the handling of images within our system, we have employed Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) as our data store. By utilizing S3 buckets, we have significantly improved request size and response time for image-related operations. This allows our application to efficiently handle image uploads, storage, and retrieval, enhancing the overall user experience.<br>
                            
                            To ensure a secure and scalable database solution, we have chosen MongoDB Atlas as our database hosting platform. MongoDB Atlas offers a fully managed cloud database service, allowing us to store and manage our data with ease. By leveraging MongoDB Atlas, we benefit from features such as automated backups, built-in security measures, and horizontal scalability, ensuring the stability and reliability of our database infrastructure.
